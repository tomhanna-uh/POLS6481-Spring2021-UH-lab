This is a repository for lab and homework information the Graduate Course in Statistical Methods (2) in the Political Science Department at University of Houston in Spring 2021. I am teaching the lab and teaching assistant for the course. The course title and description are: "Research Design and Quantitative Methods II (Methods core) - Second course in required methods sequence. Focus on the general linear model. Topics include multivariate regression, violations of model assumptions, alternative estimators, computer applications."

Lecture Materials are the product of Scott Basinger, Associate Professor of Political Science at the University of Houston. Copyright is his. 

Lab materials are the work of Scott Basinger and several generations of graduate assistants, of which I am the latest iteration. Two of my contributions are integration with Github, conscious use of R Studio Projects for data organization, and use of the here package for R for relative data paths.
